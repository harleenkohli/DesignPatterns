Learnings:

1. Evolution dictates that our brain highly optimize information and attention according to our survival needs. Hence, it is harder to learn "boring" things vs something that engages us.
1. The slow way to learn is through repetition.
1. An alternate faster way to learn is to do anything that increases brain activity (esp in different parts).
1. In other words, more nuerons firing will ensure more engagement and retention.
1. Examples to increase brain activity:
    -   Usage of pictures/graphics 
    -   Conversational style
    -   Introduction of strange/unexpected/eye-catching stuff to get attention
    -   Opportunity to "solve" something (gives you the feeling of "aha, i got it! or "i win").
 
1. Tips to learn better:
    -   Learning should be the last challenging thing to do in a day for best memorization.
    -   Make notes, this helps internalize concepts as you write things in your own words.
    -   Trying to explain something to someone is best way to learn.
    -   Take a break when you brain is starting to skim/forget/lose focus.
    -   Apply your knowledge.
